        <p>One of Rachael’s many specialties is writing and performing impressions including Ariana Grande, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Adam Sandler, Melania Trump, Lorde, Billie Eilish, and Julie Andrews among others. A sketch written, acted in and produced by Rachael and featuring her Elizabeth Warren impression was featured on Elizabeth Banks’ comedy website WhoHaha and was ranked #1 on that website for several weeks.</p>
        <blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://whohaha.com/elizabeth-warren-is-running/">Elizabeth Warren Is Running For President! Probably. Maybe.</a></h4><p>Elizabeth Warren announced that she's forming an exploratory committee to investigate a possible presidential run! HELL YEAH! Wait, but... does that mean she's running or not? Let Senator Warren (aka Rachael Burke) explain in this woman-on-the-street segment.</p></blockquote>

          <p>Rachael contributed countless on-air jokes and sketch concepts to The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon during her five years at the show. For example, Rachael's uniquely creative comedic imagination conjured up a sketch about Ariana Grande’s ponytail coming alive and stopping crime. The concept came to life in a sketch starring Ariana Grande and Jimmy Fallon that aired on the show and also garnered over 13 million views across YouTube and Facebook.

          </p>
          <p>Additionally, Rachael is an expert in social media and virality. For 5 years, Rachael oversaw the show’s social media accounts, including Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Tumblr, YouTube, Instagram, etc. accounts, growing YouTube audiences from 2 million to 19 million and the Facebook audience from 2 million to 13 million. Rachael filmed and produced countless backstage web series with guests. Some of her web series concepts that were filmed and produced include My Weirdest Role, Co-Star Superlatives, Guided Meditation, Questlove Q&amp;A, New Internet Slang, and How to Handle a Heckler. Another example of Rachael's expertise in virality was when Rachael created the most viewed GIF of 2018 according to Giphy and Mashable. The GIF featuring Cardi B, which can be seen below, has been viewed more than 475 million times.
